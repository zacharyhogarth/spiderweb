Ultralight web browser developed in Visual Studio with C#

You can currently find the executable in the \bin\debug directory as
"SuperLightWebBrowser.exe". Do not expect amazing things, it's meant to be
as small as possible and serve a basic function, like researching small things
where browser history, bookmarks, etc aren't really a requirement. That 
being said, I'll be adding things like browser tabs, bookmarks, etc in time
as I learn the ways of Visual C#.
